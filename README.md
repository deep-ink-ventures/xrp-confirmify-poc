## Introduction
In our rapidly evolving digital age, the proliferation of artificial intelligence has inadvertently given rise to an increase in fabricated content. The problem is already visible now and will increase exponentially over the next months and years.

This manipulation has extended beyond mere text, with once reliable formats such as video becoming susceptible to counterfeiting. We face an impending future where the majority of disseminated text, audio, and video could be fraudulent. 
Public figures, corporations, governments, and media organizations are continuously grappling with an overwhelming influx of deceptive announcements and publications that contradict their official policies and principles.

## Our Solution: Confirmify

We propose a solution to this escalating problem - a publishing pipeline application designed to verify authenticity. The premise of our platform is to provide clients, such as businesses, with a streamlined dashboard for managing their media content. By publishing their content through our application, it automatically becomes authenticated and verifiable.

This innovation allows consumers, ranging from journalists to social media platforms, to confirm the authenticity of content they encounter. Whether it's a video trending on Twitter or an article shared on Facebook, our application ensures that the content is genuine and originated from a verified source.
